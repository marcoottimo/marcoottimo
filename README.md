I'm Marco Ottimo, the mind behind BlackHoleDynamics, a solo dev studio where code meets the cosmos. I build games that echo the mysteries of the universe, driven by the quiet pull of curiosity and a love for the unknown. Each project is a constellation of ideas, stitched together with pixels, physics, and passion. Here, development is less about rushing to the finish line and more about orbiting around the process â€” reflecting, refining, and reaching for something a little beyond.
